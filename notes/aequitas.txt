Aequitas function 
    Input - N lists of transaction input orderings
    Output - List of transaction orderings (fair ordering)

    // For both input/output, you can have different granularity of timestamps
    // Choose granularity g -> All transactions with timestamps [1,g] are in the same bucket,
    // [g+1, 2g] are in the same bucket.

Algorithm:
    Create an empty graph
    For all pairs of transactions (a,b):
        if a < b in majority (should be >= gamma * n - f) of orderings:
            // note that x < y is also counted for an ordering even when only x is present
            add an edge (a,b) to the graph
        else if b < a in majority (should be >= gamma * n - f) of orderings:
            add an edge (b,a) to the graph

    // At this point, you have a graph G where transactions are vertices
    // and some vertices have edges between them.
    // Graph need not be complete. Graph need not be acyclic


    // Now, we need to add edges to vertices that dont have them currently.
    // Lets say vertices a and b dont have an edge between them
    // Now look at if a and b have some common descendant (some vertex thats a descendant of both)
    // If there is a common descendant,
        add (a,b) edge if a has more descendants
        (b,a) if b has more descendants
        deterministically (say alphabetically) if equal
    // If there is no common descendant, then there is currently not enough information to order both a,b
    // (one of them could still be ordered).
    // This is the streaming part. New transactions will come in later that will order a,b

    // Basically, the output list will not contain both


    // Now, to compute the output list
    
    Remove from graph G all transactions that are:
        (1) Not in all input lists or descendants of such transactions
        (2) Not fully connected
    // (now there is exactly one edge between every pair of vertices)
    // Let this graph be H
    Compute the condensation graph of H (collapse the strongly connected components into a single vertex)
    // Hopefully, any graph algorithm library you use should have this algorithm inbuilt

    Topologically sort this graph and then output the sorting (Here, every index is a set of vertices)
    
    While outputting the final list, you can just get back what transactions are in each set


// Example 1 : simple
Node 1: [a,b,c,d,e]
Node 2: [a,b,c,e,d]
Node 3: [a,b,c,d,e]

(a->b), (a->c), (a->d), (a->e)
        (b->c), (b->d), (b->e)
                (c->d), (c->e)
                        (d->e)

Output ordering: a->b->c->d->e


// Example 2: common descendant, and no common descendant
Node 1: [a,b,c,e,d]
Node 2: [a,c,b,d,e]
Node 3: [b,a,c,e,d]
Node 4: [a,b,d,c,e]
Node 5: [a,c,b,d,e]

gamma = 1 (to add an edge, you need x<y in 4 nodes)

(a->b), (a->c), (a->d), (a->e)
                (b->d), (b->e)
                (c->d), (c->e)

// b and e dont have an edge but they have a common descendant
// Lets say, we add (b,c) as the edge deterministically
// d and e dont have an edge but they dont have a common descendant either, i.e. they wont be output yet
The final output list should be a->b->c


// Example 3: have cycles, look at condensation graph
Node: TODO

gamma = 1 (to add an edge, you need x<y in 4 nodes)

(a->b), (a->c), (a->d), 
                (b->d), (b->e)
                (c->d), (c->e)
                               (e->a)  

// [a,b,c,e] are strong
The final output list should be [a,b,c,e] -> d
